When you are contributing, keep in mind the following:

- Be positive. Always accept that others can be better than you.
- Be negative, but in a good way. Only excersize constructive critisism.
- Be clean in your language.

Try and always act as though you are talking face-to-face, and remember that there is a real person with real feelings behind what you are saying. Make sure you aren't coming off as harsh or angry. That's no fun.
