# About
Welcome to GitHub! GitHub is a version control system and helps KCT run. Here is a repository, which is a group of files making up something - like KidCreatorsTeam's website! Without this repository, KCT wouldn't run.

KidCreatorsTeam or KCT is a group of kids striving to make education fun by letting kids teach other kids.
